# üöÄ SmoothWizard Server Optimizer (CSSHarp)

## About the Project

**SmoothWizard Server Optimizer** is a high-performance plugin built on the **CounterStrikeSharp (CSSHarp)** framework, designed to significantly boost server stability and improve client performance (FPS) in Counter-Strike 2.

The plugin employs an aggressive **entity cleanup** strategy at the start of every round, eliminating stagnant and resource-intensive objects that often lead to framerate drops and server instability on busy maps.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Automatic Per-Round Cleanup:** Automatically removes excessive objects and effects from the map at the start of every round.
* **High Efficiency:** Specifically targets common causes of performance degradation:
    * **Ragdolle** (Player bodies).
    * **Particles and Effects** (explosions, smoke, fire, `env_explosion`, `info_particle_system`).
    * **Decals** (Bullet holes, blood splatters, sprays).
    * **Map Junk** (`prop_physics`, bottles, cans, dynamic props).
* **Clear Notifications:** Provides a consolidated, colorful chat notification showing players the total number of entities cleaned up.
